This business case focuses on analyzing customer behavior using household-level transaction data spanning over two years. The dataset comprises:

- **Household-level transactions**: Data from a group of 2,500 households who are frequent shoppers at a specific retailer.
- **Comprehensive purchase data**: All purchases within the store are considered, not limited to specific categories.
- **Demographics and marketing data**: Demographic information and direct marketing contact history are available for select households.

## Analysis Overview
The following analyses were performed to derive insights from the data:

1. **Order Size Segmentation**: Categorize orders into small (0-5 USD), medium (5-10 USD), or large (10+ USD) based on order value.
   
2. **Top Stores by Weekly Foot Traffic**: Identify the top 3 stores with the highest foot traffic for each week, where foot traffic is defined by the number of customers transacting.

3. **Customer Profiling**: Develop a basic customer profile including first and last visit dates, number of visits, average money spent per visit, and total money spent, sorted by the highest average spend.

4. **Single Customer Analysis**: Analyze the most spending customer (who has available demographic data), showing both demographic and profiling data.

5. **Product Affinity Analysis**: Determine which products (based on the `SUB_COMMODITY_DESC` field) are most frequently bought together.

6. **Household Shopping Behavior**: Identify the weeks during which each household shops and calculate their cumulative spending over time using a "sum over partition" approach.

7. **Weekly Revenue Per Account (RPA) Change**: Calculate the weekly change in RPA (spending by each customer compared to the previous week) using the `LAG` function.

8. **Returning Customers Analysis**: Determine the number and percentage of returning customers for each week.

9. **Quarterly Sales Analysis**: Perform a sales comparison by calculating the total sales amount for each quarter (creating a new quarter column using a CASE statement for 12-week periods).

10. **Store Sales Over Time**: Analyze how sales for individual stores change over different quarters.

11. **Customer Churn Analysis**: Calculate customer churn for each quarter, where churned customers are those who never shop again after that quarter.

12. **Customer Retention Analysis**: Identify retained customers for each quarter, defined as households that were present in both previous and current quarters.

13. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Calculation**: Calculate CLV for different age groups using the following formula:
   - **Average Purchase Value**: Total value of all purchases over a time frame, divided by the number of purchases in that period.
   - **Average Purchase Frequency**: Number of purchases in a time period divided by the number of individual customers who made transactions.
   - **Customer Value**: Average purchase frequency multiplied by the average purchase value.
   - **Average Customer Lifespan**: Average length of time a customer continues buying from the retailer.
   - **CLV**: `Customer Value x Average Customer Lifespan`

## Conclusion
This comprehensive analysis provides deep insights into customer behavior, product affinity, sales trends, customer churn, and retention patterns. These insights can help businesses make data-driven decisions to enhance customer experiences and improve overall business performance.
